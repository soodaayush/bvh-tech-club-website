# Bay View High Tech Club Website

## Inspiration

Since I lead Bay View High School's Tech Club, I thought it would be best to make a central website containing all of the information about it.

## Challenges

Designing an eye-catching easy-to-browse layout that is accessible on all devices, including mobile.

## Lessons Learned

I learned about certain animations that you can use to catch people's eyes.

## The Website

This is the Bay View High School Tech Club website. In this website, you can learn more about our club, and the binary problem that was presented to students who have scanned a QR code that sends them to this page.
