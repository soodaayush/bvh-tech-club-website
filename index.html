          <p>
            The sequence of 1's and 0's make up a number called Binary. How
            Binary works is that each digit is made up of a power of 2 (e.g. 2⁰,
            2¹, 2²). For every digit that is 1, you add the power of 2's
            together to produce a number.
          </p>
          <img src="images/binary.png" class="binary-img" alt="Binary" />
          <p>
            In the example above, the 1's are filled in at exponents 2⁷, 2⁶, 2³
            and 2². Each value corresponds to 128, 64, 8, and 2, which adds up
            to 202.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any data can be represented with Binary, and letters is one of them.
            Whenever you type any letter on your keyboard, binary numbers are
            being sent to the computer to be typed in. How does that happen?
            Every letter on your keyboard is associated with an ASCII (American
            Standard Code for Information Interchange) value. These values are
            regular integers (e.g. 20), which are easier to be read by a human.
            When you add up the 1's and 0's of a Binary number of a letter, it
            should add up to the ASCII value of the letter. Using the example
            above, the ASCII value of 202 is associated with a mysterious
            letter: ╩. We keep all of the ASCII values and their corresponding
            letters on an ASCII table. This is done to provide one central place
            for where you can find your letter values.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is an example of an ASCII table (this does not include all
            ASCII values):

          <h1>1000011</h1>
          <p>Let's solve for this binary number:</p>
          <img

            class="binary-img"
            alt="'C' Binary"
          />
          <p>
            When we add our values together, it produces 67. 67 on the ASCII
            table corresponds with an uppercase C. Now we have found our first
            letter.
          </p>

            alt="'O' Binary"
          />
          <p>
            When we add our values together, it produces 79. 79 on the ASCII
            table corresponds with an uppercase O Now we have found our second
            letter.

          <p>
            When we add our values together, it produces 68. 68 on the ASCII
            table corresponds with an uppercase D. Now we have found our third
            letter. You probably see where this is going.

            When we add our values together, it produces 69. 69 on the ASCII
            table corresponds with an uppercase E. Now we have found our fourth
            and final letter.

            Piecing the letters together forms a word 'CODE'. This goes to show
            that words can be represented with Binary, which is how your
            computer understands what letters to input when you are typing on
            your keyboard.
